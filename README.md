## Project Description
The goal of this project is to practise in supervised learning using Netflix data. We need to create the model for the rating prediction. Each group will need to research and implement the defined supervised machine learning methods.
The dataset represents the information about Netflix movies and their ratings.We suppose that the rating depends on the number of votes and the movie's characteristics.

1. Please perform EDA and data cleaning. Check this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29605352/pandas-how-to-convert-a-cell-with-multiple-values-to-multiple-rows for some helpful info.
Must-have in EDA:
Number of movies per year
Movies per country
The most popular genre per year
The most popular genre per country

2. As soon as your dataset is ready, please start the research about your models. Please note, that each group member should research at least 1 model.
- LinearSVC
- KNeighborsClassifier
- MultinomialNB
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier

3. Implement your models on your data 
4. Do not forget about Hyperparameters tuning, feature selection (if needed)
5. Compare the results using metrics:
accuracy
recall
precision
ROC_AUC score
plot ROC_AUC curve
